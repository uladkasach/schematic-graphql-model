# Schematic Model
Schematic model takes graphql schema as an input and provides schema validation + object validation out of the box.

This enables the user to confidently use graphql default resolvers - guaranteeing that each model object has already been validated and will not result in errors. It also provides a way to add custom error checking to models without having to create custom resolvers.
